        <h2>Learning Rate:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning rate is a fundamental concept in training neural networks.</li>
            <li>Neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning Rate:</h2>
        <p>The main aim of the learning rate is to help the neural network learn effectively without going too fast or too slow. It tries to find the right balance between learning fast and not making too many mistakes. It's like adjusting how big the steps are as the network learns.</p>
        <h3>Factors influenced by Learning Rate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Convergence: If the learning rate is too high, the network might jump around too much, missing the best solution.</li>
            <li>Stability: If it's too low, the network might take tiny steps, which can make learning very slow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Learning Rate:</h2>
        <p>The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during the optimization process. In other words, it determines how much the weights are adjusted in response to the calculated error. A higher learning rate means the weights are adjusted more in each step, while a lower learning rate means smaller adjustments.</p>
        <h3>Effects of Learning Rate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Learning Rate:</strong> The network may converge faster, but it could overshoot the optimal weights, leading to instability or divergence.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Learning Rate:</strong> The network may converge more slowly, but it's less likely to overshoot the optimal weights. However, training might take longer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Choosing the right learning rate is crucial for successful training. It's often determined through experimentation and fine-tuning. Learning rate schedules, where the learning rate changes over time, are also commonly used to improve training efficiency and stability.</p>

        <h2>Learning Rate:</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're trying to find the highest point on a hill by taking steps. You start at the bottom and want to reach the peak.</p>
        <h3>Effects of Learning Rate:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High Learning Rate:</strong> If you take really big steps, you might overshoot the peak. For example, if you take giant leaps, you might end up on the other side of the hill without even realizing you've gone too far. Then, you'll have to backtrack, wasting time and energy.</li>
            <li><strong>Low Learning Rate:</strong> If you take really tiny steps, you'll be very cautious, but it might take forever to reach the top. You'll inch your way up, being super careful not to miss anything, but it'll be a slow journey.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimal Learning Rate:</strong> If you take steps that are just right—not too big and not too small—you'll make good progress without overshooting the peak. You'll climb steadily, making adjustments as you go, and eventually reach the top efficiently.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Common learning rates often fall within the range of 0.001 to 0.1. However, there isn't a fixed "best" learning rate, as it depends on factors such as the dataset, the model architecture, and the specific optimization algorithm being used. Developers typically start with a learning rate in this range and adjust it based on experimentation and validation performance.</p>
